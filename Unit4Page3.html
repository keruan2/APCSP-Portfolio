	<h2>4.8 - Real World Models</h2>
	<p id="Q">What are the main differences between Bill Nye's solar system model and the Second Life model?</p>
	<p id="A">The main difference between Bill Nye's solar system model and the Second Life model is that the Second Life model orbits the planets around the sun while Bill Nye's does not.</p>
	<p id="Q">(POGIL) What would happen if there were lots more wolves than there are bunnies? Would the wolves live forever? Record your hypothesis, prediction and experiment results.</p>
	<p id="A">If there were to be more wolves than bunnies, then the wolves will eventually eat up all of the bunnies and will lead them to die. After doing the experiment this was true on the medium-sized forest for both toroid and island as the wolves ate all of the bunnies and ended up dying out. But if it was a large forest size the wolves will live forever as the bunnies will grow fast enough for them not to die out allowing the wolves to eat.</p>
	<p id="Q">(POGIL) This model chose to include certain features and exclude other features. For example, this simulation only includes rabbits, wolves, and grass but there are other predators of rabbits and other food sources for rabbits. Why do you think the creators focused on these data elements and not others? How might this introduce bias (concentration on or interest in a particular area) into the simulation?</p>
	<p id="A">The creator didn’t include the entire ecosystem because the point of the simulation is the relationship between wolf, rabbit, and grass. The other organisms may be to distracting for the user. The creator focus on rabbit, wolf and grass because it’s a relatively simple concept to understand. This might introduce a bias towards rabbits in this simulation because wolves doesn’t have interspecies competition. </p>

	<h2>4.9 - Abstraction: Inside the CPU</h2>
	<p id="Q">"Which generation of the 4-bit simulators above is the most abstract? Why?</p>
	<p id="A">I believe generation 2 of the 4-bit simulator was the most abstract because it allowed you to deal with more abstract and symbolic names for instructions and data.</p>
	<p id="Q">Explain the purpose or function of the RAM and the CPU. </p>
	<p id="A">The function of the RAM is to store information very quickly since it is the computers short term memory. The function of the CPU is to handle the calculations and most of the data since it is the "brain" of the computer. </p>
	<p id="Q">Describe in your own words the difference between the fetch and execute steps. </p>
	<p id="A">The difference between fetch and execute steps are fetch is to go and retrieve the data while execute is to run the data. </p>
	<p id="Q">Summarize the differences between assembly language and machine language programming.</p>
	<p id="A">The difference between assembly language and the machine language programming is machine language programming uses binary and hexadecimals while assembly language uses symbols.</p>

	<h2>4.10 - Impacts of CS: Privacy</h2>
	<p id="Q">Is it possible to identify someone, perhaps a patient, knowing just the gender, birth date, and zip code? Why or why not?</p>
	<p id="A">Yes it is possible to identify someone knowing their gender birthdate and zipcode since there is usually not more than 5 people in an area with the same birth date and gender.</p>
	<p id="Q">Are electronic documents like paper documents? Write 2-3 sentences comparing and contrasting them.</p>
	<p id="A"> Both electronic and paper documents are used to show some type of message. Electronic documents can be more anonymous than paper documents since there is no trace of the printer used. Some information about the writer of the document can be found on paper documents like fingerprints or any trace of DNA.</p>
	<p id="Q">Earlier in the course, you built the Map Tour app. In the final version, what kind of data is collected from the user? Does the user know the data is being collected? Can they opt out of providing data and still use the app?</p>
	<p id="A">Data collected from the user is there location which is stored in TinyDB, I believe the user does not know that their data is being collected. I believe the user cannot opt of providing data and still be able to use the app</p>
	<p id="Q">Is the Privacy Act effective? Explain why or why not.</p>
	<p id="A">The Privacy Act is somewhat effective because there are many ways around the act but to a certain extent it does help protect a citizens privacy. </p>
	<p id="Q">Are you willing to trade some of your privacy for the convenience of having a computer or a company recommend products to you? Why or why not? Under what circumstances?</p>
	<p id="A">I am not willing to trade some on my privacy for the convience of having a computer because I do not want a company to watch/ spy on what I am doing. I just think its kinda creepy that some companys like social media companys already do things like that. The only circumstance that I am willing to trade my data is if my family is in danger and to save them I will have to give up my privacy.</p>
	<p id="Q">How do we leave digital "footprints and fingerprints?" Do you think this is important for everyone to know? Why or why not?</p>
	<p id="A">We leave digital "footprints and fingerprints" by using online websites that track our data and stores it in their own "TinyDB", even using your computer right now it leaves a digital footpring and fingerprint since everything is stored either on the cloud or on their own storage system. I think it is important for everyone to know since it is our data theyre taking from us.</p>
	<p id="Q">How have social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. affected our privacy?</p>
	<p id="A">Social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat have affected our privacy since many people like to post daily about things they eat, vacations they're on, parties they're at, dances they went to, literally everything about their daily lives. This means it is easier for a person who dislikes you to find and track you since their whole life is on the internet.</p>
	<p id="Q">In this course, you are building apps that collect data from users, the device, and its sensors. What responsibilities do we have as app developers for the data we collect?</p>
	<p id="A">I think a responsibility I have as an app developer when we collect data from other users is keeping it safe and not using it for personal gain since it is someones private information</p>
	<p id="Q">Search the web for a recent news story that deals with privacy. LINK to the article and then write a paragraph summarizing the article, including any beneficial or harmful impacts on privacy. </p>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/15/google-almost-made-chest-x-rays-public-until-it-realized-personal-data-could-be-exposed/">
	<p id="A">This article was about google almsot sharing 100,000 images of chest x-rays to the public. Google ended up not sharing that data since the hospital that shared this data made a call to google saying that it violates a perosnal privacy because these images can be linked to the person if found. After google dropped their project using these x-ray files instead they're working with the hospital to ensure a patients privacy before starting their "NIH" project again. This shows that even big tech companies do not know how much something very little can effect someone drastically. Even thought Google is a big companies many other companies also have been learning about privacy too like fitbit (mentioned in the Google Article).  </p>
